ABSTRACT = {The technique of 3D scanning laser Doppler vibrometry has recently appeared as a promising tool of nondestructive evaluation of discontinuity-like defects in composite polymers. The use of the phenomenon of local defect resonance (LDR) allows intensifying vibrations in defect zones, which can reliably be detected by means of laser vibrometry. The resonance acoustic stimulation of structural defects in materials causes compression/tension deformations, which are essentially lower than the material tensile strength, thus proving a nondestructive character of the LDR technique. In this study, the propagation of elastic waves in composites and their interaction with structural inhomogeneities were analyzed by performing 3D scanning of vibrations in Fast Fourier Transform mode. At each scanning point, the in-plane (x, y) and out of plane (z) vibration components were analyzed. The acoustic stimulation was fulfilled by generating a frequency-modulated harmonic signal in the range from 50 Hz to 100 kHz. In the case of a reference plate with a flat bottom hole, the resonance frequencies for all (x, y, and z) components were identical. In the case of impact damage in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic sample, the predominant contribution into total vibrations was provided by compression/tension deformations (x, y vibration component) to compare with vibrations by the z coordinate. In general, inspection results were enhanced by analyzing total vibration patterns obtained by averaging results at some resonance frequencies.},

abstract="From a non-destructive evaluation point of view, Lamb waves are a highly attractive means of inspecting a large area of a structure from a single location. Interdigital transducers (IDTs) which make use of the piezoelectric properties of the polymer PVDF have been used previously in signal processing applications [1] to generate acoustic waves in piezoelectric substrates. Over the last two years, work has been carried out at Imperial College [2,3] to design PVDF IDTs that are capable of transmitting and receiving ultrasonic Lamb waves in non-piezoelectric plates for non-destructive testing purposes. Such transducers can be permanently bonded to a structure and hence have potential uses in smart structure applications. A schematic diagram of a simple PVDF IDT is shown in Figure 1. The wavelength and frequency of a single Lamb wave mode in the structure are selected by the spacing of the fingers in the IDT and the frequency at which the IDT is excited. Further details of their construction can be found in [2].",

	abstract = {The numerical solution of linear discrete ill-posed problems typically requires regularization, i.e., replacement of the available ill-conditioned problem by a nearby better conditioned one. The most popular regularization methods for problems of small to moderate size, which allow evaluation of the singular value decomposition of the matrix defining the problem, are the truncated singular value decomposition and Tikhonov regularization. The present paper proposes a novel choice of regularization matrix for Tikhonov regularization that bridges the gap between Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition. Computed examples illustrate the benefit of the proposed method.},
