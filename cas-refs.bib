ABSTRACT = {The technique of 3D scanning laser Doppler vibrometry has recently appeared as a promising tool of nondestructive evaluation of discontinuity-like defects in composite polymers. The use of the phenomenon of local defect resonance (LDR) allows intensifying vibrations in defect zones, which can reliably be detected by means of laser vibrometry. The resonance acoustic stimulation of structural defects in materials causes compression/tension deformations, which are essentially lower than the material tensile strength, thus proving a nondestructive character of the LDR technique. In this study, the propagation of elastic waves in composites and their interaction with structural inhomogeneities were analyzed by performing 3D scanning of vibrations in Fast Fourier Transform mode. At each scanning point, the in-plane (x, y) and out of plane (z) vibration components were analyzed. The acoustic stimulation was fulfilled by generating a frequency-modulated harmonic signal in the range from 50 Hz to 100 kHz. In the case of a reference plate with a flat bottom hole, the resonance frequencies for all (x, y, and z) components were identical. In the case of impact damage in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic sample, the predominant contribution into total vibrations was provided by compression/tension deformations (x, y vibration component) to compare with vibrations by the z coordinate. In general, inspection results were enhanced by analyzing total vibration patterns obtained by averaging results at some resonance frequencies.},

abstract="From a non-destructive evaluation point of view, Lamb waves are a highly attractive means of inspecting a large area of a structure from a single location. Interdigital transducers (IDTs) which make use of the piezoelectric properties of the polymer PVDF have been used previously in signal processing applications [1] to generate acoustic waves in piezoelectric substrates. Over the last two years, work has been carried out at Imperial College [2,3] to design PVDF IDTs that are capable of transmitting and receiving ultrasonic Lamb waves in non-piezoelectric plates for non-destructive testing purposes. Such transducers can be permanently bonded to a structure and hence have potential uses in smart structure applications. A schematic diagram of a simple PVDF IDT is shown in Figure 1. The wavelength and frequency of a single Lamb wave mode in the structure are selected by the spacing of the fingers in the IDT and the frequency at which the IDT is excited. Further details of their construction can be found in [2].",

The present paper proposes a novel choice of regularization matrix for Tikhonov regularization that bridges the gap between Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition.

First, we discuss different transducer technologies, including both piezoelectric and non-conventional popular and non-conventional piezoelectric transducers. Next, we examine guided-wave theory, tracing its early history down to modern developments. Following this, we detail the efforts into models for guided-wave excitation by SHM transducers. Then, we review several signal processing related works. The next topic in Section 6 is guided-wave SHM system development, and we explore various packaging ideas, integrated solutions and efforts to examine robustness to different service conditions. We also highlight the broad spectrum of applications in which this technology has been tested. We then present some investigations that have attempted to combine guided-wave approaches with other complementary SHM technologies for better system performance. Finally, we propose desirable developments for further advancement of this field.},

	abstract = {The inspection of large structures using conventional ultrasonic bulk wave techniques is slow because scanning is required if the whole structure is to be tested. Ultrasonic guided waves potentially provide an attractive solution to this problem because they can be excited at one location on the structure and will propagate many metres. However, guided wave testing is complicated by the presence of many possible wave modes, most of which are dispersive. These guided wave characteristics offer a wealth of opportunities for the extraction of information about the structure, but it is crucial to manage this complexity if the test is to be useable in industrial practice. This paper concentrates on long range testing using frequencies below 100 kHz. The progress from research work to a robust, commercial pipe testing system will be discussed, together with more recent research on applications to plates and railroad rails. The paper concludes with a discussion of future research opportunities.},

	abstract = {Damage is an inevitable occurrence in metallic structures and when unchecked could result in a catastrophic breakdown of structural assets. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is adopted in industries for assessment and health inspection of structural assets. Prominent among the NDE techniques is guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT). This method is cost-effective and possesses an enormous capability for long-range inspection of corroded structures, detection of sundries of crack and other metallic damage structures at low frequency and energy attenuation. However, the parametric features of the GWUT are affected by structural and environmental operating conditions and result in masking damage signal. Most studies focused on identifying individual damage under varying conditions while combined damage phenomena can coexist in structure and hasten its deterioration. Hence, it is an impending task to study the effect of combined damage on a structure under varying conditions and correlate it with GWUT parametric features. In this respect, this work reviewed the literature on UGWs, damage inspection, severity, temperature inﬂuence on the guided wave and parametric characteristics of the inspecting wave. The review is limited to the piezoelectric transduction unit. It was keenly observed that no signiﬁcant work had been done to correlate the parametric feature of GWUT with combined damage effect under varying conditions. It is therefore proposed to investigate this impending task.},

This work envisions significant advancements in spacecraft safety and operational longevity through the development of cutting-edge GWs-SHM technologies, urging for continuous innovation in sensor technology, algorithm development, and the integration of artificial intelligence for smarter decision-making in the challenging space environment.},

	abstract = {In this study, a two-level scanning strategy for a noncontact laser ultrasonic measurement system is proposed to expedite the inspection of a wind turbine blade. First, coarse scanning of the entire blade is performed with a low spatial resolution for initial delamination localisation. Then, dense scanning with a high spatial resolution is performed only within the identified delaminated region for delamination visualization. This study especially focuses on the initial delamination localisation using adaptive coarse scanning. Laser ultrasonic responses from two pitch-catch paths, names inspection pairs, are obtained within a specified coarse scanning grid. Then, potential delamination locations within the given grid are estimated through time-of-flight analysis of delamination reflected waves. Once potential delamination locations are estimated, new inspection pairs are placed near the potential locations for precise localisation. These steps are repeated for every coarse scanning grids on the target wind turbine blade. The feasibility of the proposed technique for rapid delamination detection is demonstrated with a 10 kW glass fibre reinforced plastic wind turbine blade.},

	abstract = {Guided wave–based SHM methods have been explored extensively in recent decades. The wave propagation modelling including piezoelectric transducers and various damage types helps understand intricacies of guided wave behaviour and for designing a robust SHM system. However, modelling aspects are still challenging. Moreover, commercially available software for the modelling of guided waves often lacks appropriate high-order elements and code optimization for fast GPU computations. This research aimed to develop and disseminate to the SHM community the open software based on highly efficient vectorised code of the time domain spectral element method which can be run on GPU.},
